## What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all the code. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc.). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

5. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
